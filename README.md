# PeptDes

Deep Reinforcement Learning experiments for structure-based protein design.

-**SB3_swap.ipynb**: Google Colab notebook to run RL experiments using [stable-baseline3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) (lighter implementation than Ray)

-**set_environmet.sh**: for installing pytorch and Ray with its training, tuning and RLlib modules
